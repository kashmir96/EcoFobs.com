## Making Shopping Greener: Sustainable Practices for Retail Stores
As retail businesses look to reduce their carbon footprint, sustainability is emerging as a key factor in both business operations, as well as customer motivations. Implementing sustainable practices in retail stores is not only good for the environment, but also improves customer satisfaction and drives loyalty. 

The most effective way to incorporate sustainability into a retail store is to evaluate sustainability in the four cornerstones of retail operations: product sourcing, packaging and shipping, sales, and customer experience. 

When sourcing products, be mindful of their sustainability component. Choose suppliers and manufacturers who are engaged in responsible forms of production, such as reusing and recycling materials. Where possible, source locally to reduce the environmental costs of transportation. Consider also carrying eco-friendly product lines for customers to choose from. 

When packaging and shipping, sustainable materials should be used in place of non-recyclable options. This can include natural materials like cardboard, paper, and tape instead of plastic. Reusable materials like reusable mailers and cardboard boxes can also be considered. 

In-store sales should also consider sustainability. Eliminating the use of paper receipts and envelopes that generate paper waste is an effective tactic. This can be achieved by setting up an automated receipt system for customers, or replacing physical receipts with digital ones. 

Finally, the customer experience is a key component of sustainability. Implementing technologies that reduce line wait times, while ensuring that customers are informed on product sustainability can increase customer satisfaction while helping the environment. Consider using RFID key fobs, like our Eco-Friendly Wooden RFID Key Fobs which allow customers to move freely in and out of stores without the need for paper or plastic cards. 

Implementing sustainable practices in retail stores is an effective way to drive customer loyalty while helping the environment. To ensure an effective sustainability plan, businesses need to take into account the four cornerstones of retail operations as well as new technologies that reduce paper/plastic waste.
