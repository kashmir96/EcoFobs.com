## Sustainably Sourced Event Venues

For businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact, discovering sustainable event venues is a great way to implement environmentally conscious practices. Not only will going green enhance your company’s public image, but it also will demonstrate a commitment to making the world a better place. In this blog post, we will explore some tips for finding sustainable event venues and will provide some ideas for how businesses can go a step further and use eco-friendly promotional items to enhance their sustainability message. 

The first step in finding a sustainable event venue is to research a variety of potential venues. Ensure that the venue you pick fits with your company’s mission and values by researching how the venue makes use of renewable energy, is powered by efficient lighting, and sources its materials locally. Additionally, proper waste management practices should be a priority in your venue search. Make sure the venue is able to provide certified compostable items, as well as recycling containers to divert as much waste as possible.

The next thing to consider is whether or not the venue allows you to bring in outside food and beverages. If possible, try to source your food and beverages from local, organic, and ethically managed suppliers to reduce packaging and shipping costs. This will not only benefit the environment, but it will also reduce your event budget! Additionally, using reusable or compostable tableware will help you be more conscious of the materials you are leaving behind. 

Moreover, you will want to make sure the venue you choose encourages attendees to carpool or take public transportation in order to reduce the number of cars on the road. Offering incentives, such as a parking voucher or small gift bag, is a great way to promote eco-friendly transportation for your event.

Finally, you can further reduce your company’s carbon footprint by utilizing eco-friendly promotional items to your event. Selecting products made from recycled or renewable materials, such as our [Eco-Friendly Wooden RFID Key Fobs](/eco- friendly-rfid-key-fobs), are a great way to demonstrate your commitment to protecting the planet and to remind your attendees of your sustainable practices.
