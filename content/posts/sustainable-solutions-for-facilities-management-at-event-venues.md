## Towards Sustainable Facilities Management
Event venues present unique challenges when considering sustainable practices, due to the often high volume of attendees and short time duration of events. However, implementing sustainable solutions can have a long-lasting and substantial environmental impact. 

When planning event venues and managing facilities, key areas of consideration should include: 
 
 - Alternatives to single-use items such as plates, cups and cutlery
 - Replacing disposable hand towels with hand dryers and reusable towels 
 - Upgrading lighting and other electronic systems to energy efficient solutions 
 - Using RFID key fobs or cards instead of plastic keys
 - Implementing proper waste disposal and recycling practices
 - Utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar or wind 
 
While many of these solutions may require some upfront investment costs, such actions also enable event venues to save on energy and water costs in the long run. In addition, investing in sustainable products also helps organizations to demonstrate their commitment to environmental stewardship and can positively influence attendees, guests and business partners. 

At Eco-Events, we specialize in providing eco-friendly wooden RFID key fobs which are a sustainable substitution to plastic keys. Our key fobs come in different shapes and colors and can be easily tailored to match company branding and logos. Abolishing plastic keys with wooden NFC tags would not only reduce the amount of plastic waste but also increase business appeal and responsibility to the environment. 

Sustainable practices can help event venues to improve efficiency and minimize their environmental impact. While there may be challenges when introducing these solutions, taking the necessary steps can enable organizations to meet sustainability goals and enjoy long-term cost benefits.
