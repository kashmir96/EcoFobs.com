## Putting on Sustainable Events with a Green Twist 
Nowadays, being conscious of the environment is more important than ever before, and businesses have taken note. As a result, more and more companies have committed to reducing their carbon footprint, using renewable energy sources, and making sustainable choices wherever possible. If you’re planning an event for your business, this is a great way to stay mindful of the environment— and even impress clients with your commitment to sustainability. 

To get started on event planning with a green twist, think about ways that you can become a leader of environmental-consciousness on the day of your event. Check in with yourself on if there are any policies that you could implement to further reduce your carbon footprint. This can come in the form of ensuring that all disposable items used are biodegradable or compostable, or providing guests with convenient and eco-friendly transport options. Additionally, you may want to consider utilizing reusable serveware, such as wood or bamboo plates, and encouraging the use of reusable beverage containers. 

Another way to make your event eco-friendly is to incorporate green giveaways and swag into it. Invest in items made of recycled materials, or products that minimize waste. When it comes to souvenirs and giveaways, why not offer guests a stylish and functional eco-friendly RFID key fob? That way, they can take home a meaningful and useful reminder of their day with your business. 

Event planning with a sustainable twist is a great way to show your commitment to the environment. It’s an innovative and efficient way to have a positive impact on climate change, and show that you truly care about the environment. Plan ahead, look for renewable options, and get creative with all the possibilities!
