## Unlocking the Benefits of Sustainable Event Venues for Sustainability-minded Businesses

Sustainable event venues are becoming increasingly popular for businesses looking to reduce their carbon footprint and embrace eco-friendly practices. Sustainable facilities management encompasses every aspect of event planning and management, from selecting materials and floor plans to deciding what type of lighting and other impactful choices to make. Facilities managers are increasingly turning to strategies such as lifecycle assessment to ensure the environmental and financial sustainability of their event venues. This article will illustrate how businesses can make use of sustainable facilities management to reduce their environmental impact while reaping the many benefits of running an eco-friendly venue.

One of the most important elements of sustainable facilities management is the selection of materials. Buildings, furniture, decorations, and other items all add to the overall environmental impact of the venue. Businesses should therefore select these materials carefully, ensuring they are made of renewable and/or recyclable materials, sourced sustainably, and designed to be as efficient as possible. Civic bodies, government organizations, and others should also consider appropriate floor plans, floor materials, and alternative options such as solar power to reduce their carbon footprint.

Another key area of sustainable facilities management is energy. Businesses that prioritize energy efficiency can reduce the amount of energy used to power the event venue and gradually reduce costs as well. From LED lighting systems to on-site solar energy sources, there are plenty of options to choose from. Modern buildings can also be equipped with smart thermostats and other technologies that allow for real-time, automated energy efficiency.

Finally, businesses must consider the sustainability of their waste management systems. An effective waste management system should reduce the amount of waste created by the venue, eliminate the use of toxic or hazardous materials, and separate bio-based waste from other waste streams. These waste streams should be reused, recycled, or composted whenever possible. Businesses should also ensure that their waste management policies are in line with local laws and regulations.

Sustainable event venues offer environmental, economic, and social benefits. By taking the necessary steps to adopt sustainable facilities management, businesses can reduce their environmental impact and help protect the planet in the long run. Additionally, sustainability-minded businesses can benefit from cost savings and increased customer loyalty, creating a win-win situation for businesses and the environment.
