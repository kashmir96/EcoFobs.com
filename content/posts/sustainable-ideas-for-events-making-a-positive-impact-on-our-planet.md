## Making Events More Sustainable and Eco-Friendly
Organising events has a significant environmental impact, but it doesn't have to be that way. With more businesses wanting to reduce their carbon footprint and be more eco-friendly, implementing sustainable practices when putting together events can make a positive impact on our planet.

For events with a large physical presence, such as conferences, trade fairs and festivals, there are a few simple measures that can be taken to ensure the event is as environmentally-friendly as possible. Events that are run entirely or largely online, such as webinars, do not require as much physical infrastructure, but there are still digital sustainability practices that can be adopted.

Providing reusable digital tickets such as RFID Key Fobs can reduce your events paper waste, and help ensure that tickets are secure and protected from counterfeiting or unwanted transfer. For example, our [Eco-Friendly Wooden RFID Key Fobs](/eco-friendly-rfid-key-fobs) are made from 100% recyclable wood and FSC-certified paper. In addition, providing reusable food and drink containers is a great way to reduce single-use plastic waste.

When organising events with physical presence, it's important to consider the number of materials being used during the event. A great tip is to choose items that can be reused or recycled. From furniture to decorations, utilising eco-friendly, sustainably sourced materials will reduce your overall impact on the planet. And when it comes to marketing, consider using digital channels such as email, social media and digital signage, rather than printed posters and flyers.

Producing any kind of event requires resources and energy, with many activities creating a relatively large environmental impact. By taking sustainability into account and implementing eco-friendly practices during the planning and organising stages, you can help to minimise the environmental impact of your event and make a positive difference.

When it comes to organising events that are both entertaining and sustainable, our Eco-Friendly Wooden RFID Key Fobs are the perfect choice - helping you reduce your events paper waste, and make sure your tickets are secure.
