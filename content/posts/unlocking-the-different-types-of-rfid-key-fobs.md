## Unlocking the Benefits of RFID Key Fobs

As more businesses become focused on reducing their carbon footprint, implementing eco-friendly practices, and running sustainable operations, RFID key fobs present an excellent way to achieve these goals. RFID, or radio frequency identification, is a technology which emits electromagnetic waves in order to send information between two metal objects. With this system, a business can securely unlock doors and control access to certain areas.

The most basic type of RFID key fob is a simple magnetic card or tag which must be brought close to the reader in order to work. This requires the user to manually swipe the card or tag against the reader in order to gain access. For businesses looking to increase their security and reduce the hassle of manual swiping, more advanced types of RFID key fobs are available. These include proximity cards which allow for hands-free access, as well as biometric readers which use fingerprint or facial recognition technology to verify the user's identity.

When considering which type of RFID key could be most beneficial to an organization, it is important to consider how much security is needed and how easily access needs to be granted. For example, while a proximity key fob is much more convenient, it may not be as secure as a biometric reader. If a business or organization's security is of utmost importance, the more advanced types of RFID key fobs are ideal.
