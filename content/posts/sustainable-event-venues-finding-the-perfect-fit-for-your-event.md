## Finding the Right Sustainable Venue for Your Event 

Organizing an eco-friendly and sustainable event requires more than just good intentions. Attention must be paid when selecting a venue to ensure that event planning and execution are aligned with sustainable values and practices. You must consider the total amount of waste generated, carbon emissions, and if the existing infrastructure and amenities are already geared towards sustainability. 

When looking for a venue, you can start by looking for venues that are already LEED or Green Seal certified. These certifications guarantee that after a detailed inspection, the venue has been deemed compliant with sustainability criteria. Additionally, venues can provide sustainable materials, energy efficiency, and locally-sourced catering options. Furthermore, some venues will also offer rental items such as bulk silverware and disposable plates that are made from compostable materials such as plant-based plastics. 

When going through the planning stages, it’s also important to evaluate the transportation accessibility of the venue since this can significantly impact the overall carbon footprint of your event. Ask yourself if it is easy for guests to access the venue. Are there public transportation options nearby or are they accessible by carpooling? Will it be expensive and/or inconvenient to rent buses or shuttles as an additional option?

In short, it’s important to do your research when selecting a venue for your next event to make sure that your sustainability values are not compromised. Also, don’t forget to have guests return to their homes with Eco-Friendly Wooden RFID Key Fobs from id-Ally as a lasting reminder of your commitment!
