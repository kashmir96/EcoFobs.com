## Finding a Sustainable Events Venue for Environmental-Conscious Events

Sustainability is a key requirement for many businesses and organizations. With an ever-increasing focus on reducing waste and carbon footprints, finding a sustainable event venue is a must for those looking to hit their environmental mark. Here, we'll explore the different factors you should consider when assessing the sustainability of an event venue and how to find and implement the best venues.

When you're looking for a sustainable event venue, the first thing you should assess is the venue’s commitment to recycling, reuse and conservation. This includes reevaluating whether items can be recycled and reused, such as furniture and decorations. Knowing what kind of materials the venue uses for these items can also be a good indicator of sustainability — for example, using reclaimed wood or recycled glass for furniture and decorations. Additionally, research the venue's energy consumption and the type of energy sources used to power the event. Using renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, is a great way to ensure an event is more sustainable.

In addition to checking the venue's usage of renewable energy sources and recyclable materials, look into the venue’s food and beverage practices. Many event venues source locally-grown ingredients and use compostable cutlery. You can also assess if paper straws, plates and cups are being used or if the venue practices a bring-your-own policy. Doing research into a venue's food and beverage sustainability practices can help you determine if it meets your environmental goals.

Finally, try to investigate the venue’s overall environmental mission and if they have an environmental sustainability certification or accreditation. It's also worthwhile to look into the venue’s past event reviews and ratings to see what other event goers and organizers have said about the overall sustainability of the venue.

Taking into account the kind of materials used, energy sources employed, food and beverage practices, mission and reviews, can help you find the most suitable and sustainable event venue for your organization and its environmental objectives. 

Finding the right venue for your event is no easy task — but it is possible to find one that meets your sustainability needs. With a clear focus on the venue’s commitment to sustainable practices and a thorough research process, you can ensure the perfect environment for your event. 

When looking for eco-friendly event venues, it's also important to remember the event badges and access cards.
