## Hosting a Low-Impact Event for Eco-Conscious Businesses 

When it comes to event planning and hosting, there are many ways to reduce the environmental impact of your event and remain mindful of your company’s sustainability practices. By incorporating sustainable strategies, your business can stay green, help conserve the planet’s natural resources, and still provide guests with an exceptional experience. 

When planning an event, think about alternative materials to use such as biodegradable plates and utensils, recyclable napkins, and compostable table linens. These items are usually more affordable and create minimal impact on our natural environment. Additionally, select an event venue that is conscious of their energy usage and utilizes low-flow sinks, LED lighting, composting programs, and other green initiatives. 

When inviting guests to your event, opt for electronic invites instead of paper. They save both time and paper, and add the convenience of helping you keep track of your RsVPs more easily.

Though it can be difficult to adjust to all the necessary sustainable event guidelines, by taking the time to plan and make sustainable choices, you can ensure that your event is both enjoyable and eco-friendly. 

At the end of the event, take the necessary steps to repurpose as much event materials as possible. Have left-over food donated to a local food pantry and compost items that are compostable. For good measure, be sure to share the sustainable event guidelines with your guests.
